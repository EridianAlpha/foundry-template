# Foundry Template Files

This repo contains template files for a new Foundry project.

This is not a Foundry project but contains the files that can be copied into a new project after running `forge init`.

Think of the example spaceship created by Hactar for Krikkit in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy - Life, the Universe, and Everything. This is the model ship, not a working ship itself 🚀🏏
